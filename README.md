1. Homework Projects for CS249

# Projects for Resource Analysis, T-Tests, OLS Regression

Various HW Projects for CS249. Completeness in the codespace varies, as was using multiple scripts for parts of the work in order to submit in the format required by the professor. 

2. Problem Statement & Motivation

Resource Analysis: Cleaning Data, counting data and sum, aggregating each by CPU, Disk, and Memory to determine how many working sets and threads are used
Manufacture Log: Processing text to determine batch_id, product codes, quantities inside of designated timeframes
Customer Feedback: Determining whether sentiment of customer feedback changed in time using t-tests
Final (OLS Regression): Using Regression to do sentiment analysis regarding stock news

3. Data Source
Various data sources provided by professor in CSV

4. Technologies Used

Example:

**Python**

**JupyterNotebook**

**Pandas** for data manipulation

**NumPy** for numerical operations

**SciPy** for machine learning models and evaluation

**StatsModels**

**Natural Language ToolKit**

7. How to Run the Project

`To run this project, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed.

```bash
pip install pandas scipy nltk nmpy statsmodels
```

You can then open the notebook in JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab resource_analysis.ipynb
jupyter lab manufacturelog.ipynb
jupyter lab customer_feedback.ipynb
jupyter lab 'CS 249_hw.ipynb
```
`
